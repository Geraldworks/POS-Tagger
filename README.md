# POS Tagger

In this project, we were required to implement a Part of Speech Tagger using probabilistic methods such as maximum likelihood estimation. We then expanded the project to incorporate hidden Markov models and employed dynamic programming methods such as the Viterbi algorithm to efficiently compute the maximum probability of tags in a given sentence.
